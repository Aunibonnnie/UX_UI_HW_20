<h1>The Women's Center</h1>

<p>“We believe improving the women’s center website for those needing to escape or heal from an abusive relationship will achieve a safer, more discreet, and overall better experience to recreate a normal life”.
</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">
      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>The Women’s center website was designed to provide those involved in abusive situations with safe resources, support, and aftercare. We have observed that the website has no navigation hierarchy which could cause confusion when looking for fast resources on a time limit. How might we improve the center’s website so clients can quickly and discreetly access resources?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p>Based off of our user interactive testing for The Women’s Center website, we were able to create a better hierarchy and a user friendly website for the target audience.    
        We began creating a user-friendly navigation, conducting user tests, user flows and creating a new site map for The Women’s Center to create a friendly navigation with proper hierarchy for their users. 
        We also decided to add in a live chat feature as well and make the exit button to be a bright red Escape button.
        We wanted The Women’s Center to be a comforting, reassuring and safe space for the users in need. Creating a new color palette with hues of turquoise, green and purple and providing imagery that emanated empowerment and reassurance.
        We accomplished our task of creating a user-friendly website for The Women’s Center.

        <h5 class="card-title">Research</h5>
        <p class="card-text">When conducting our survey and user interviews our primary goal was to understand the user's needs. If I was recovering or stuck in an abusive situation what needs would I want to be provided for me during this dangerous and hostile time. Where would you go, if you went to a website where would you navigate to? What website would you use, so we can base this as a starting reference for our redesign. As well as, what colors convey a calm and safe space to you?
          The key findings we derived from our surveys and user interviews is that many of our users have dealt with this type of situation to varying degrees and many would use the phone service and National Domestic Hotline website for help. Contact and reliable resources are most important to them and the colors they chose that conveyed a safe and calm space would be blue and purple.

      <p>Based on our user interviews we created an Affinity diagram to categorize our user needs. We grouped everything together from Resources to Primary Resources our users thought were important to them, Advice they would give to their friends, Common helplines and Places they would offer to someone who was stuck in this situation and Colors combinations that convey calmness. (Purple, green and blue). 
        With this information we moved onto our ideation method and chose 5 topics we thought were important to us. 
 like how you can easily exist out of the website 
        I wish the name of the organization was different if they support not only women
        I wish the website URL wasn’t so obvious what it linked to and instead looked like something unsuspecting
        What if there was a list of reported/convicted significant others who were abusive in relationships available on the website
        What if they could provide me with the perfect husband.

  We then moved onto our value proposition focusing on features that provided 24/7 contact for our users, available resources (harbor house, PPO, Volunteer), user friendly navigation and an easy exit plan for our users to feel safe.
	With the Heuristic Evaluation finished we combined our thoughts and took notes of what could be improved upon the site. As again, The Women’s Center navigation had no hierarchy and needed to be fixed, however the website's main focus was providing reliable information, 24/7 contact availability and an exit plan for their users, that we wanted to implement into our redesign.
	Within our redesign our user persona Emily Smith is able to leave her abusive relationship, from using the provided 24/7 contact availability. Because of this we thought of including a live chat feature for the The Women’s Center website to further add onto the 24/7 availability, as this is their primary goal for their users. 
	As such, our user flow consisted of contacting The Women’s Center, with three easy ways to fulfill such a task, by using the Hotline number, Chat connect (Messaging/Live chat) or accessing the Contact page. 
	The last bit of adjustments we decided to add was to finally fix the navigation by conducting a card sorting into 4 categories Legal Help, Support Services, About Us, and Get Involved. We were able to categorize everything into primary and secondary hierarchy, creating a user-friendly navigation.

        <p class="card-text">During the stages of creating our redesign we started with our paper prototype, everyone decided that contact info should be placed at the homepage as well as be provided onto every page. A hero page should be placed on the homepage as well as other pages with a big image on the front that conveys empowerment and reassurance.
          Are low/mid-fidelity prototype testing was a success with a few needed tweaks. We adjusted the “Exit” button to be changed into “Escape” to create less confusion for the user. As we kept working the navigation needed some readjusting from changing the color hues from purple to green and brightening up the red to be a more saturated red, as well as adjusting and finding our font size, we completed our style guide. Incorporating our guide to create the following web pages, (About page, Pets and Domestic Violence page and Harbor House page).

  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Applying our style guide to the rest of the pages we created our high fidelity prototype and conducted our high-fidelity user testing. Key takeaways we took from our user testing was to change the text layout of some of the pages and to adjust our navigation to be less buggy. 	 
	We went to our final testing the A/B user testing for any final adjustments focusing on the appearance and the vibe we wanted to portray into our redesign of calm, reassurance and empowerment. We found that many people like the color purple for our design, so we changed it to purple. The advocate for The Women’s Center was perfect as one user said “The woman I chose seems to embody strength and resiliency” no further adjustments were needed for the escape button.

      <p>The Women’s Center organization provides for victims and survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. With the limited time we had to work, we all wished we could have seen what the entirety of the website would have looked like completed. It would have been special if the school allowed us to offer our support to these non-profit organizations through our website design. However, most importantly it would have been nice if we had gone out and conducted more personal user interviews to people who are a part of the organization, go to support groups and ask them what they think is important, what they want to see to the people they provide to help.
